You are the **Spy**.

You do **not** know the secret location.

Your objective is to deduce the location by listening to the questions and answers of other players.
- Blend in by asking general questions and giving vague answers.
- Avoid being too specific, as this may reveal your lack of knowledge.
- If you think you know the location, you may be able to reveal yourself and make a guess. A correct guess wins you the round.
- If you are accused, try to deflect suspicion onto someone else.
