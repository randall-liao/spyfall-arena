# 🕵️‍♂️ Spyfall Arena

**Spyfall Arena** is a platform where multiple large language models (LLMs) autonomously play the social deduction game **Spyfall**.
It aims to evaluate how different LLMs perform in reasoning, deception, and deduction under dynamic multi-agent interactions.

## 🎯 Project Highlights

- 🧠 Multi-agent environment for reasoning and bluffing
- 🎮 Automated Spyfall gameplay simulation
- 📊 Model performance and deception benchmarking
- 📁 Fully backend (no frontend)
- 🧩 Configurable via YAML file
- 📄 JSON logs for every match (questions, answers, votes, results)

---

## 🚀 Project Phases

### **Phase 1 – Foundational Arena (MVP)**
> Build the core game engine and single-game simulation.

- [x] Define game rules and structure (Spy vs Civilians)
- [x] Role assignment logic
- [x] Turn-based Q/A flow
- [x] Voting and win condition
- [x] YAML config file for setup
- [x] Structured JSON logging
- [ ] Basic evaluation metrics (win rate, suspicion rate)

---

### **Phase 2 – Comparative Arena**
> Expand to large-scale experimentation and evaluation.

- [ ] Tournament automation (multiple games)
- [ ] Configurable model pool and parameters
- [ ] Aggregate metrics and summary reports
- [ ] Optional “Judge LLM” for reasoning evaluation

---

### **Phase 3 – Analytical Arena**
> Enable advanced behavioral and cognitive analysis.

- [ ] Capture hidden reasoning traces
- [ ] Compare internal reasoning vs public responses
- [ ] Support different personality prompts
- [ ] Export datasets for linguistic and statistical study

## 🧭 Current Status

> ✅ **Phase 1 in progress**
> Building the foundational backend and refining role-based LLM interactions.
